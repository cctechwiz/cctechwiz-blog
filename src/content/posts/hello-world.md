## Introduction

My name is Josh Maxwell I am married to a strong, amazing woman and we have two beautiful girls. We live in Utah and love the mountains and all kinds of outdoor activities.

I currently work as a Systems II Engineer at [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/) on the Database Engineering team. My primary focus is building better developer tooling around databases (creation, management, interaction, monitoring, etc). While currently on the database team, I do plan to pivot in the near future to the Developer Experience team. They are focused on creating better developer experiences across Qualtrics by creating more intuitive and accessible tools.

## Backstory

After graduating High School and serving a 2 year mission in Florian√≥polis Brazil for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I attended Southern Utah University (SUU) and earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, with an emphasis in computer & network security. It was during undergrad that I married my longtime sweetheart, Jessica.

After graduating SUU we moved to Pittsburgh, PA for me to attend the Information Networking Institute (INI) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), where I earned my Master's degree in Information Security (MSIS), with an emphasis in system level code security and exploitation. Our first daughter joined our family during this time.

After graduating CMU we moved to New Mexico where I worked as a Software Security Engineer at Sandia National Laboratories. My responsibilities included building mostly command line applications and system integrations to support cyber resiliency R&D, experimentation, and execution. One such project I can share is [Netmeld](https://github.com/netmeld/netmeld), which a coworker and I were able to open source. While living in New Mexico our second daughter mader her appearance.

After a few years in New Mexico we decided we wanted a change of scenery and that's when I joined Qualtrics, where I'm currently employed. Over the last year, due to the global pandemic, I've been able to work from home (at Sandia and Qualtrics) and have discovered I really thrive in that type of work environment (barring all pandemic related anomolies).

## Current Quest

I am on a quest to explore the vast open world of software development. While I enjoy the work I am doing now I don't foresee myself doing this kind of work forever, at least not in my current capacity. I would really like to start my own business in the future, although presently I'm unsure exactly what that future looks like for me and my family. This blog will help me document my journey as I experiment with other domains and try to find where I can grow into next.

In addition to documenting my professional journey and interests, I also plan to include some of my adjacent hobby projects and interests as well. The format of the site will most likely change over time to better support cataloging and discovering these different topics.

I am always open to honest and constructive feedback. Feel free to get in touch with me over on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cctechwiz) or via the [contact form](/contact) on this site.

Until next time! Stay safe, and don't forget to love each other.
